            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>Our desire is to inform the public of local weather and <br>
                how it may affect their daily tasks, while also providing <br>
                the flexibility to help you travel without being surprised <br>
                by the weather there. We also aim to keep local residents <br>
                aware of any weather emergencies that may arise.</p>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>Our audience will vary widely, and include people of all <br>
                walks of life, but we will focus on those age 18-80, and <br>
                those who spend valuable time outside or on the road. We <br>
                hope to keep such people informed enough to make safe <br>
                and convenient decisions regarding the weather where <br>
                they reside. To do this we make our services available <br>
                on tablets and mobile devices.</p>
